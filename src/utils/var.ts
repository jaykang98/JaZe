// For Node.js context, this would work directly, but for a web app, you might need a different approach for managing tokens

// If these are function imports, you would instead import them directly at the top of your file

// Exporting an array of functions directly like this in TypeScript isn't common unless they're already defined functions
// Instead, you should export functions directly from their respective modules
